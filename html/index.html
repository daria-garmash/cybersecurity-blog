                <h3>Common Vulnerabilities in Web Applications</h3>
                <h4>Web Apps, Cyber Attacks, Hacking </h4>
                <p>These days Web Applications are one of the most popular targets for cyber attacks.
                    To protect the valuable data and assure availability it is crucial to be aware of the
                    popular security weaknesses that hackers utilise to compromise the app's CIA.
                   Here are some of the most widespread vulnerabilities:
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b> Security Misconfiguration:</b>
                        Incorrectly defined and implemented security settings can lead to the exposure of PII and
                        other sensitive data, unauthorized access, etc. It is extremely important to follow security
                        best practices, continuously review and update configuration, and scan for any misconfigurations
                        using automated tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Lack of Logging and Monitoring: </b>
                        This prevents the detection of security breaches and can cause delayed response to
                        incidents and increased data loss.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: </b>
                        This includes incorporating various software modules that have known vulnerabilities
                        that can be exploited by threat actors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b> Unvalidated User Input:</b>
                        It is crucial to validate user-entered input, because otherwise,
                        attackers might gain unauthorized access to your app's data through code injection or
                        cross-site scripting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b> Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):</b>
                        Occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user input,
                        without proper authorization checks. Proper access controls should be implemented to prevent this.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Are Humans The Weakest Link In Security?</h3>
                <h4>Security Awareness, Social Engineering, Phishing, Insider Threat </h4>
               <p>
                  A lot of security professionals believe that humans are generally prone to errors, negligence,
                   or intentional malicious actions and therefore can compromise even the most reliable technical
                   defence systems.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                  Attackers commonly use social engineering techniques like phishing or baiting to exploit flaws in
                  human psychology and gain unauthorized access to the systemâ€™s data. Also, a lot of people make the
                  mistake of thinking that a breach will never happen to them, so they avoid following cybersecurity
                  best practices, such as creating strong passwords and not reusing them, locking devices which are
                  left unattended, or even as simple as not sharing sensitive information about their work with strangers.
              </p>
             <br>
             <p>
                Another threat which is very real is the insider threat.
                 The term describes a person who intentionally or unintentionally misuses their access privileges.
                 It is usually done for personal gain or to do damage to the company. Unintentional misuse of
                 privileges usually happens as a result of human error.
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>
               While all of the above is true, our professional expertise can be critical in stopping cyber attacks.
                 A perfect example would be the case of the WannaCry ransomware attack back in 2017.
                 A cybersecurity researcher was able to conclude that the malware could be defeated by simply
                 registering a domain.
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>
                All in all, humans can surely cause a lot of vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the unique characteristic
                 of the human race is that we can learn, bring useful insight, and eventually create innovations that
                 benefit the security field. A balanced approach should be taken by companies to leverage both human
                 strengths and technological stack to create a comprehensive and resilient cybersecurity strategy.
